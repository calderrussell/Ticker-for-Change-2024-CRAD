    <p><b>Teen Health Center</b></p>
    <p>What is the Cambridge Teen Health Center?
      The Cambridge Teen Health Center, in partnership with Cambridge Health Alliance (CHA), is a school-based health clinic located in the CRLS health office. The center is staffed by a full time Nurse Practitioner and mental health specialists – psychiatrists, psychologists and social workers. We are essentially a primary care clinic that is housed in the high school. Our goal is to reduce the barriers to accessing primary care, sexual health, and mental health care by offering these services in a convenient location. When school is in-person, students do not have to miss school (and parents/guardians do not have to miss work) in order to address their physical and mental health needs.<p></p>

      <p><b>What services are available at the THC?</b></p>

      <p>Physicals
      Immunizations, including flu vaccine
      Sexual and reproductive health services such as counseling, birth control, STI testing and treatment, pregnancy tests
      Mental health counseling
      Psychiatry</p>
        
      <p><b>Who can access these services?</b></p>
      <p>Anyone between the ages of 12-24 years old. Free care is available for CRLS and Extension students who are uninsured based on support from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. Sexual and reproductive health education and care is FREE and CONFIDENTIAL (parent/guardian consent is NOT required) for all students.</p>

      <p><b>Appointment Information</b></p>
      <p>Access is easy. Students can be seen during the school day, avoiding the need to set up an appointment offsite at their medical provider's office. We hope you will encourage your student to use this convenient and excellent health care service.</p>

      <p><b>For PRIMARY CARE and SEXUAL HEALTH appointments</b>:<p>
      <p>Call 617.665.1548 to schedule an appointment with the nurse practitioner. Or students can walk in to schedule an appointment.</p>

      <p><b>For MENTAL HEALTH services/counseling</b>:</p>
      <p>Students, parents/guardians, teachers, any concerned adult can fill out the referral form for counseling services (click here to start the referral process). We do NOT provide crisis mental health services. Once the referral is placed, the mental health referral coordinator will reach out to the parent/guardian to schedule an intake appointment. The intake appointment is the initial appointment when the mental health provider meets with the student and parent/guardian. The subsequent appointments are only with the student.</p>
